# FLEETCOM.gmx
2d top-down rts in Microsoft's Halo Universe

For those without Game Maker Studio, there should be pre-built executables in the builds/ dir. (only for windows atm)

FLEETCOM departs from the traditional RTS by making units slow and unresponsive, akin to large naval ships in modern times.
More thought is then required from the player on unit movement and placement.
